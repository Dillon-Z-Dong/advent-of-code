# advent-of-code
My Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com) solutions. 

2024-python contains the (mostly unedited and fairly low quality) code that I used to solve the 2024 problems as they came out.

After 2024, I'm planning on doing previous years' problems to learn new languages / techniques. Will be starting with 2023 problems in a combination of Python and Go (2023-python-go).
